# whereTheLightGathers-blot
A theme for the Blot blogging platform

This theme was heavily inspired by the designs of [Leo Babauta](https://leobabauta.com) website [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/) and the work of [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com). 

This is a theme foe use with the [blot.im](http://blot.im) blogging platform. It's wonderful, you should check it out.

This theme is authored by [Chad Moore](https://chadmoore.net). Feel free to fork it and modify it. Send me an [email](mailto:chad@chadmoore.net) to tell me all about the cool things you do with it.



## Install

1. I am not sure how to install this, I'll update this when I figure it out.



## Customization

You'll have to edit the `entry.html` and `entries.html` files to remove my cusomizations. I'm uploading this as is. I'm sure there's better ways to do what I did with this, so please improve it.

As for styles, you'll have to be mindful of the purple. #9A14CC and #bd8ece are the colors I've used. You can edit them in lines 15 and 16 of the `style.css` file. 

I've left the microblog.html and microblog.rss files if you want to edit those to include a [micro.blog](http://micro.blog) feed in your site. I wrote a tutorial on that, [here](https://blog.chadmoore.net/2019/04/04/setting-up-blotim.html).

You'll have to edit the `head.html` file to make the site your own.

And `script.js` and `public.html`if you want webmentions
